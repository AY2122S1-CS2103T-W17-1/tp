**InternSHIP is a desktop app for university students to manage their internship applications.** InternSHIP has been optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InternSHIP can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
