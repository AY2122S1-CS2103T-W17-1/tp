## Introduction

Are you a university student looking to score a holiday internship? Do you feel overwhelmed by all the application details you have to keep track of? Have you missed any application deadlines because there are just too many to remember? Have you ever wished that there were a comprehensive app that could help you track your entire internship application process? If you answered yes to any of these questions, we have just the application for you!

![Logo](images/InternSHIP.png)

InternSHIP is a **desktop app for university students to manage their internship application deadlines.** Here are its main features:
* Tracking all essential internship application details (e.g. submission deadlines, interview date and time, completion status, etc...)
* Viewing specific applications

Now you will never miss any internship application deadlines or interviews again!

InternSHIP has been optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InternSHIP can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

We hope you find InternSHIP to be very useful in your internship hunt!

**Information boxes**

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> :information_source: **Info:** Information boxes provide extra information that might be useful!
</div>

**Tips**

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: **Tip:** Tips are pointers that can help to improve your experience using InternSHIP!

</div>

**Highlights**

`Highlights are used to emphasise special text such as parameters, field values, commands, file names or any user inputs.`

### Navigating the GUI
TO BE DONE AFTER WE FINALISE THE UI!!

### Command format

All the commands in the [Features](#features) section adhere to the following rules:

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. if the User Guide states `add COMPANY_NAME`, users can input `add Shopee`, or any other company name.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: **Tip:** Go to our [glossary](#glossary) and [parameters](#parameters) sections to find out more about parameters!
</div>

* Items in square brackets are optional. <br>
  e.g `c/COMPANY_NAME [r/REQUIREMENT]` can be used as `c/Shopee r/CV` or as `c/Shopee`.

* Items with `…​` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. <br>
  e.g. `[r/REQUIREMENT]…​` can be used as `r/` (0 time), `r/CV` (1 time), `r/CV r/Resume` (2 times) etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `c/COMPANY_NAME p/INTERNSHIP_POSITION`, `p/INTERNSHIP_POSITION c/COMPANY_NAME`
  is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command while you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `c/Grab c/Shopee`, only `c/Shopee` will be taken.

* For commands that do not require any parameters (such as `list` and `clear`), any parameters input by the user will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `list 123` will be interpreted as just `list`.

## Features

This section shows all of InternSHIP's supported commands and how they should be used.

The commands are split in terms of InternSHIP's main features:
* [Tracking application details](#tracking-application-details)
* [Viewing specific applications](#viewing-specific-applications)
* [Others](#others)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: **Tip:** To make the best use of this section, make sure to familiarise yourself with the [command format rules](#command-format) and [parameters](#parameters) used!
</div>

### Tracking application details

#### Adding an application : `add`

Adds a new entry to the application list in InternSHIP. <br>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> 
:information_source: **Info:** <br>
Minimally, the following fields are required when a new entry is added: <br>
- `COMPANY_NAME` <br>
- `INTERNSHIP_POSITION` <br>
- `APPLICATION_DEADLINE` <br>
<br>
There are three fields that receive their default values. <br>
These fields can be changed later using the `edit`, `complete` or `accept/reject` commands respectively. <br>
- `APPLICATION_PRIORITY`: set as `Medium` <br>
- `COMPLETION_STATUS`  set as `Uncompleted` <br>
- `APPLICATION_OUTCOME` (i.e., application status) set as `Pending` <br>
<br>
Additionally, `APPLICATION_REQUIREMENTS`, and `INTERVIEW_DATE_AND_TIME` are optional fields that can either be specified or not. <br>
If not specified at this stage, it can still be added and edited later using the `edit` command.
</div>

Format:
`add c/COMPANY_NAME p/INTERNSHIP_POSITION d/APPLICATION_DEADLINE [r/APPLICATION_REQUIREMENTS]…​ [i/INTERVIEW_DATE_AND_TIME]…​`

* Adds a new application with the specified field values to the list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: **Tip:** You can input more than one `INTERVIEW_DATE_AND_TIME` since many companies have multiple rounds of interviews for a single application!
</div>

Examples:
* `add c/Shopee p/software engineer d/2021-12-12` adds a new internship application to `Shopee` as a `software engineer`, with the application deadline `12 December 2021`.
* `add c/Shopee p/software engineer d/2021-12-12 r/resume` adds a new internship application with the same details as the previous example, but with an additional application requirement of a `resume`.
* `add c/Shopee p/software engineer d/2021-12-12 r/resume i/2021-12-18 1030` adds a new internship application with the same details as the previous example, but with an interview on `18 Dec 2021 10:30`.

<hr>

#### Editing the details of an existing entry : `edit`

Edits the fields of a specified existing entry in the application list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> 
:information_source: **Info:** <br>
The fields that can be edited using this command are: <br>
- `COMPANY_NAME` <br>
- `INTERNSHIP_POSITION` <br>
- `APPLICATION_DEADLINE` <br>
- `APPLICATION_REQUIREMENTS` <br>
- `INTERVIEW_DATE_AND_TIME` <br>
Editing any field is optional, but least one field must be edited each time. <br>
Multiple fields can be edited at the same time.<br>
<br>
For the edited fields, existing values will be overwritten and updated to the new input values. The values for the rest of the fields will remain the same.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary"> :bulb: **Tip:** <br>
For the optional field `APPLICATION_REQUIREMENTS`, you can remove all the requirements at once by giving only `edit r/` without specifying anything after the prefix. 
Similarly, the command `edit i/` will remove all the interview date and times of an application.
</div>

Format: `edit INDEX [c/COMPANY_NAME] [p/INTERNSHIP_POSITION] [d/APPLICATION_DEADLINE] [pr/APPLICATION_PRIORITY] [r/APPLICATION_REQUIREMENTS] [i/INTERVIEW_DATE_AND_TIME]`

* Edits the application at the specified `INDEX`.

Examples:
* `edit 1 c/Grab d/2021-12-20` changes the company name and deadline of the 1st application to `Grab` and `2021-12-20` respectively.
* `edit 2 p/UI designer` changes the internship position of the 2nd application to `UI designer`.

<hr>

#### Completing an application : `complete`

Marks the specified entry in the application list as completed, meaning the user has completed the application for that internship.

Updates the application outcome (status) of an application to **'Accepted'**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> 
:information_source: **Info:** <br>
The application outcome is the **decision/outcome provided by the company** <br>
on whether the candidate has been `Accepted` or not for the role. <br>
It is different from the 'Completion Status', which represents whether the <br>
user has completed submitting the application (and all related requirements) or not. <br>
<br>
When a new application is added, the outcome is `Pending` by default as it is assumed <br>
that the user has not received the decision from the company yet. The outcome can <br> 
later be changed to `Accepted` using the `accept` command. <br>
<br>
</div>

Format: `accept INDEX`

on whether the candidate has been `Rejected` or not for the role. <br>
It is different from the 'Completion Status', which represents whether the <br>
user has completed submitting the application (and all related requirements) or not. <br>
<br>
When a new application is added, the outcome is `Pending` by default as it is assumed <br>
that the user has not received the decision from the company yet. The outcome can <br> 
later be changed to `Rejected` using the `reject` command. <br>
<br>
</div>

Format: `reject INDEX`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger"> :warning: **Warning:** This command is to be used after a command that actually **does some change** to the application list. Inappropriate use may result in unexpected behaviors. </div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">   
:information_source: **Info:** <br>
Commands that actually 'does some changes' to the application list (thus can be undone):
- `add`

Successive `undo` commands will undo the previous changes from the most recent to the oldest, until there's no changes
to be restored.
</div>

<hr>

Format: `undo`

Examples:
* `delete 1` followed by `undo` undoes the deletion of the first entry. As a result, that entry will reappear
in the application list.
* `edit 1 p/tester` followed  by `undo` undoes the edition of the first entry's position field. 
As a result, the `position` field of that entry will be restored to its previous value.

<hr>

#### Redoing a change : `redo`

Redoes a change made to the application list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger"> :warning:
This command is to be used **directly after** an `undo` command.

and it is followed by a command that makes some new changes to the application list (e.g., `edit 2 pr/High` changes
the priority of the second entry to 'High'), then the previous undone action cannot be redone (i.e., the `delete 1`
command which is previously undone cannot be redone).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger"> :warning:
When successive undone actions are made, the `redo` command will redo the **most recent** undone action.
Successive `redo` commands will redo the undone actions from the most recent to the oldest, until there's no undone
actions to be redone.
</div>

Format: `redo`

Examples:
* `delete 1` followed by `undo` and then `redo` undoes the deletion of the first entry. As a result, that entry will reappear in the application list.
* `edit 1 p/tester` followed by `undo` and then `redo` undoes the edition of the first entry's position field.

<hr>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates 
with the file that contains the data of your previous InterSHIP app home folder.

**Q**: How can I save my data in the app?<br>
**A**: InternSHIP data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command changes the data. 
There is no need to save manually.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tips :bulb:

* Commands that change the displayed list in InternSHIP (e.g. `find`, `sort`) can be used in conjunction with commands that take in `INDEX` as a parameter (e.g. `delete`, `complete`) so that you can work faster!
  * e.g. `find c/Grab` followed by `complete 1` can help you quickly find the application you made to Grab and mark it as completed, instead of slowly searching through your entire list of applications!

* Commands that change the displayed list in InternsHIP (e.g. `find`, `sort`) can also be used in conjunction with each other!
  * e.g. `find c/Grab` followed by `sort pr/` shows all the applications you made to Grab, sorted from higher to lower priority!
