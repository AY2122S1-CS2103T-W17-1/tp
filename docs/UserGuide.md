AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add Shopee`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `COMPANY_NAME/INTERNSHIP_POSITION`, `INTERNSHIP_POSITION/COMPANY_NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `delete 1 2`, only `2` will be taken as the index to be deleted.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
